# Northcoders House of Games API

## Set-up 

To run this backend server locally you first need to configure your enviroment files. 

Please create the following two files;  
```
.env.development
.env.test
```
Inside these files add the following line;
```
PGDATABASE=DATABASE_NAME_HERE
```
If you are unsure, check the /db/setup.sql for the correct name for each database.
Please ensure that the enviroment files are added to your .gitignore if they are not automatically.
